# MSO-Scripts

### _Democratizing Windows Performance Analysis_

## Documentation

MSO-Scripts substantially facilitates the use of Microsoft's Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) technology for analyzing the resource consumption (CPU, Memory, I/O, Handles, Registry, ...) and performance behavior of Windows and its applications, particularly Microsoft Office.

MSO-Scripts also [reveals detailed network activity](https://github.com/microsoft/MSO-Scripts/wiki/Network-Activity) by way of an add-in for the Windows Performance Analyzer (WPA).

Please see [the wiki](../../wiki) for detailed documentation.

## Quick Start

There are eleven customizable scripts for tracing various system resources:
* TraceCPU
* TraceFileDiskIO
* TraceHandles &nbsp; (_Kernel, GDI, and USER handles_)
* TraceHeap &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(_Windows Heap + VirtualAlloc_)
* TraceHeapEx &nbsp; &nbsp; (_Windows Heap + VirtualAlloc + Handles_)
* TraceMemory&nbsp; &nbsp;(_RAM usage, etc._)
* TraceMondo &nbsp; &nbsp; (_CPU + FileDiskIO + Handles + Network + Defender_) 
* TraceNetwork &nbsp; (_Chromium, WinHTTP, WinINet, LDAP, WinSock, TcpIp_)
* TraceOffice &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (_Excel, OneNote, PowerPoint, Word: ETW Trace and Office Logs_)
* TraceOutlook &nbsp; (_ETW Trace and Office/Outlook Logs_)
* TraceRegistry

The scripts accept these tracing commands: Start, Stop, View, Status, Cancel<br/>
These commands, except View, require Administrator privilege.

To trace CPU activity:
* Download and unzip [a recent Release of MSO-Scripts](releases), or clone the Repository: `<> Code â†“`<br/>
* _MSO-Scripts_\\`TraceCPU Start`<br/>
_Exercise the application/scenario._
* _MSO-Scripts_\\`TraceCPU Stop`
* _MSO-Scripts_\\`TraceCPU View` &nbsp; _Launches the [Windows Performance Analyzer](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/performance-diagnostics/wpa-intro/)_

List all options for TraceCPU:
* _MSO-Scripts_\\`TraceCPU -?`
